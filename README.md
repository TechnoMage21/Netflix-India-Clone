# Netflix Clone (Static Site)

This is a static clone of Netflix's user interface created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project mimics the look and feel of Netflix's homepage, including various features like movie cards, a navigation bar, and a banner section. This clone does not include user authentication, video streaming, or dynamic content from APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: For styling the page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Used for any dynamic interactions, such as opening and closing the menu or controlling the carousels.
